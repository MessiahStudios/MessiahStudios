# Back For More
As of 8/13/24 (roughly 2 years later) with the aid of Open AI's ChatGPT4 im now getting closer to having a true Cross-Platform Game. I've heard of Progressive Web App (PWA) but haven't had the time to truly appreciate the power of a PWA. Most devices should be notified about the ability to download and play offline. That means no more boring road trips, also when the internet goes down you can still play.
