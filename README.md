## Back For More
As of 8/13/24 (roughly 2 years later), with the aid of OpenAI's ChatGPT-4, I'm getting closer to having a true Cross-Platform Game. For those wondering, Cross-Platform means that you can play **Divine Gems** on pretty much any device – whether it's your smartphone, tablet, laptop, or even a smart TV. No need to worry about compatibility; just match those gems wherever you are!

I’ve heard of Progressive Web App (PWA) but hadn't taken the time to appreciate its power until now. Most devices should notify you about the ability to download and play offline. That means no more boring road trips or waiting rooms – and even when the internet decides to take a break, you can still keep matching those Divine Gems!

But here’s the real kicker: **Divine Gems** is the perfect game to keep your kids entertained during church service without raising too many eyebrows. Just think of it as a modern way to count blessings – in gems! And if you’re an adult in desperate need of a brain break during the workday, this game’s got your back. Matching symbolic gems while the clock ticks down is the kind of stress relief that’s both divine and gem-tastic!
